Project: Hybrid PTX Analysis for GPU Accelerated CNN Inferencing Aiding Computer Architecture Design

The use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for general-purpose applications has seen a significant increase in recent years. From embedded devices to supercomputers like Summit, GPUs are now extensively utilized across various electronic devices. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training and inferencing, in particular, have greatly benefited from GPU acceleration, offering superior performance compared to traditional CPUs. However, the high power consumption associated with GPUs poses a challenge in terms of energy efficiency, both in supercomputers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

This research project aims to address the energy efficiency concerns of GPU-accelerated applications, specifically focusing on the training and inferencing of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To achieve energy-efficient applications, three strategies are typically considered: designing energy-efficient devices, optimizing application implementation, and optimizing the chosen device for the specific application. While the first two strategies are long-term approaches, the third option holds potential for optimizing energy efficiency by supplying only the necessary performance for a given task.

To effectively optimize energy efficiency, information about the potential GPUs used for specific tasks, such as CNN inferencing, is crucial. Standard metrics used for predicting power consumption and performance include branch efficiency, the number of instructions, and the number of floating-point operations. However, obtaining these metrics requires code profiling and execution analysis for all possible setups.

Existing approaches for code profiling and analysis include classical profiler tools, simulators, and static code analysis. However, each approach has its limitations. Profiling tools rely on actual GPUs and suffer from inconsistent performance counters across different GPUs, making metric comparison challenging. They are also time-consuming and require access to each GPU being evaluated. Simulators, while providing availability without actual GPU access, execute applications on CPUs, resulting in longer execution times and differing results compared to profiling. Static code analysis, while time-efficient, cannot analyze dynamic behavior and may underestimate or overestimate certain metrics.

To address these limitations, this research project proposes a hybrid PTX analysis approach called Hybrid PTX Analyzer (HyPA). HyPA combines the advantages of static analysis and dynamic simulations to compute metrics efficiently. By analyzing only the parts of the code that influence conditional jumps, HyPA overcomes the time-related drawbacks of full simulations. This hybrid approach offers a more time-efficient and precise analysis, capable of determining metrics inherently based on dynamic analysis.

The main contributions of this project include:

1. The development of HyPA, a hybrid PTX analyzer that considers dynamic dependencies within the code without executing the entire application.
2. Automatic extraction of PTX code metrics such as the number of instructions, floating-point operations, number of divergent branches, and branch efficiency.
3. Implementation of HyPA as an open-source project, providing a valuable tool for developers, computer architects, and researchers to improve their work in the field of GPU-accelerated applications.

By enabling detailed profiling and analysis of GPU applications, HyPA empowers researchers and developers to optimize power consumption, performance, and code understanding in the context of GPU-accelerated CNN inferencing and computer architecture design.
